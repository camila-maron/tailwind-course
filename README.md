# 🎨 Tailwind CSS Course

This repository contains my progress, exercises, and projects from a **project-based Tailwind CSS course**, focused on building beautiful layouts using the utility-first approach.

## 🧠 Course Overview

This is a **hands-on course** designed to help you master **Tailwind CSS** by building real-world projects — from small UI components to complete landing pages.  
Unlike frameworks like Bootstrap, which rely on pre-built components, Tailwind uses **utility classes** that give you full control over your designs.

## 🧩 Course Structure

### ✔️ Fundamentals

The course starts with a coding sandbox to experiment with all key aspects of Tailwind CSS.  
Each video introduces a new concept in a separate file, allowing for structured, incremental learning.

Topics include:

- Colors
- Typography
- Spacing & sizing
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Borders, shadows, and effects
- Responsive utilities
- Dark mode
- Transitions and animations

> 💡 These sections are great for understanding Tailwind’s utility-first approach before jumping into projects.

### ✔️ Mini Projects

Once the basics are covered, the course moves into **mini-projects**, each designed to be completed in about 10–20 minutes.  
These help reinforce concepts by building small, self-contained UIs.

Mini-projects include:

- 📩 Email Subscribe Card
- 💰 Pricing Grids
- 🛍️ Product Modal
- 🖼️ Image Gallery
- 🔐 Login Modal

### ✔️ Website Projects

Finally, the course dives into **full landing page websites**, using real-world designs provided by **Frontend Mentor**.  
These projects combine everything learned — layout, responsiveness, and even a bit of JavaScript for interactivity.

Projects include:

1. **Clipboard** — Software landing page using flexbox, alignment, and background images.
2. **Loopstudios** — VR company site with gradient overlays, responsive menus, and animations.
3. **Shortly** — Link shortener app with a responsive menu and JavaScript form validation.
4. **Testimonial Grid** — Focused on mastering Tailwind’s grid utilities.
5. **Fylo** — Product page with light/dark mode and tabbed FAQ section (JavaScript + localStorage).
6. **Bookmark** — Browser extension landing page with tabs, a hamburger menu, and background effects.
